Design patterns = These repeating structures of design and architecture can be documented and summarised

-	The essential definition of a design pattern is a well-worn and known good solution to a common problem
-	Design pattern are definitely not new
-	Rather, they are old techniques that have shown their usefulness over a period of many years
Benefits
-	 What => Solutions to commonly occurring problem
	+ Design patterns are based on past experience from expert designers
	+ This includes catalogues of aspects of class-based designs
-	Why => Help us get a design right faster
	+ Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful diagrams and architectures
-	How => Capture best practice in OO design
	+ Design patterns help choose design alternatives that make a system reusable
	+ This avoids alternatives that compromise resusability 
	+ A design pattern is not a finished design

=> There are many design patterns, one of the major contributions of the GoF pattern book was that they organised
	patterns based on their purpose and scope,
	so that users can refer to families of related patterns.
	Understanding the related patterns often helps determine the most effective pattern to use for a specific problem

5 patterns in this unit 
(You may find some of them useful for our assignment)
1. Strategy: => Behavioral design pattern
	+ This allows one to flexibly change the strategy for a problem without changing the rest of the implementation.
	+ It is a bit similar to the template method but in this case we do not have a "template of flow" here.
	+ Each strategy could have a totally different flow.
	+ Let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
2. Command: => Behavioral design pattern
	+ This  allows one to design a set of commands that can do some jobs.
	+ The commands are independent of each other and can be executed sequentially.
	+ Thus, one can implement Undo/Redo feature using this pattern
	+ Client can make requests without knowing anything about the actual action that will be performed
3. Observer: => Behavioral design pattern
	+ This allows one to develop UIs that can display changes of data without interfering other processes.

	+ Such a UI can be attached and detached flexibly

	+ A one-to-many dependency between objects
4. Singleton: => Creational design pattern
	+ This allows one to have only one globally shared instance of a class

5. Abstract Factory: => Creational design pattern
	+ This allows one to build a class that creates a family or a set of objects.
	+ It is different from Factory Method, which uses a method to create some objects.

A. Strutural patterns:
-	Structural patterns often use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations

-	For example, consider how multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one.

-	Structural patterns determine how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures:
	+	Class-based: Use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.
		Classes (e.g libraries) may be developed, compile, or tested independently, and would work together with structural patterns.
	+	Object-based: Compose objects to realise new functionality.

B. behavioural patterns:
-	are the biggest catalogue of GoF design patterns
-	are mainly used with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
-	They are the most used and can be found in many libraries and applications, and describe the patterns fo communication between objects and classes
	, in addition to structures of objects or classes
-	Behavioural patterns characterise complex control flow that is difficult to follow at run-time
-	Most behavioural patterns use object composition (rather than inheritance), 
	describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task and promote decoupling between the two objects.
	
C. Creational patterns:
-	are concerned with object creation.
-	They aim to abstract the object creation process and help design a system independent of how its objects are created and composed.
-	Creational patterns are most useful for systems that depend more on object composition than class inheritance:
	+ Class-based: use inheritance to vary the class that is instantiated
	+ Object-base: May delegate instantiation to another object.
-	Some design patterns:
	+ Singleton: 
		+ ensures a class only has one instance
		+ the sole instance of a class
	+ Abstract Factory:
		+ An interface for creating families of objects
		+ Families of product objects
	+ Builder:
		+ How a composite object gets created.
	+ Prototype: 
		+ Class of objects that is instantiated
	+ Factory Method:
		+ Subclass of object that is instantiated
