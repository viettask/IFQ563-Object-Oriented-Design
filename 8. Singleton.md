Singleton -> Creational design pattern

-	ensures that a class has only one instance
-	provides a global point of access to that instance.
-	The name Singleton is borrowed from the singleton set, which is defined to be a set containing one element.
-	The structure of Signleton pattern is quite simple, only one class is involved.
=>	Instead of showing a class diagram with only one class, we show the actual code of the class.
	
Problem: 
	+ Want certain class to only have one instance
	Ex: One file system, one windows manager, one prime minister.
Forces:
	+ Multiple clients want to share a single unique instance of a class
	+ This should be extensibile through subclassing

Đặt vấn đề:
-   trong nhiều trường hợp, cần đảm bảo chỉ có 1 thể hiện của 1 lớp.
    Ex: Trong hệ thống quản lý ng dùng, chỉ nên có duy nhất 1 đối tượng UserManager để quản lý ng dùng
- Nếu tạo nhiều đối tượng UserManager có thể dẫn đến:
    + Dữ liệu bị trùng lặp
    + Xung đột tài nguyên
    + Khó kiểm soát
Giải quyết:
-   Singleton giải quyết bằng cách đảm bảo chỉ tạo duy nhất 1 thể hiện trong toàn bộ chương trình

Ex:

	public sealed class SingletonGraph : Graph {​
    ​
        private static SingletonGraph instance;​ // static field used to store the sole instance
        // The reason why we use a static field is that there is only one instance of static field shared by all instances of the class
        ​

        //Marking constructors private would make sure that no other class can create objects from this class
        // because private constructors can only be called within the current class
        private SingletonGraph() {​
            // initialise the graph here​
        }​
        

        //public static property to get instance
        //The sole instance is created by a static method ( note that static methods are not shared by objects created from the class)
        public static SingletonGraph Instance() {​
            if (instance == null)​ //Alternatively, the sole instance can be created at object initialisation, and then the Instance() method will simply return the instance
                instance = new SingletonGraph();​
        return instance;​
        }​     
        // implement graph here​
     }​


Take note:
-   Since the Singleton class encapsulates its sole instance, it can have strict control over how and when clients access it.
-   The sole instance can be extended by inheritance, so clients should be able to use the extended instance without modidying the code.
-   Remember to consider the following when using Singleton creational patterns:
    + Sole instance for a class
    + Provide a global point of access to the instance
    + Support lazy initialisation
    + Sole instance is extensible by subclassing
