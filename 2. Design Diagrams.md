Design of good OO software is not simple:
- Buiding large software = complex parts
- OO design:
+ how to design CRC cards
+ how to professionally communicate object-oriented designs by means of design diagrams
+ The fundamental principle for OO design and for using various design principles/patterns 
	+ to keep classes separated
	+ prevent them from having to know too much about one another.
	+ to achieve this separation => encapsulation and inheritance.
+ OO design patterns are a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

During the design phase, it's important not to always accept the first solution that comes to mind.
Identifying alternatives and considering their implications throughout the decision-making process often helps to produce a better design outcome.

Design choices when approaching OO design, not right or wrong.
Some choices may be better than others.
+ Simplicity =  We use simpler architecture. This is related to the KISS and YAGNI design principles.
+ Extensibility = fewer dependencies in our software. This is related to most of the SOLID design principles.
+ Reusability = More modular design to allow code to be more usable. This is related to DRY and some SOLID principles (such as single responsibility)

The most commonly used approaches in industry, using the following 4 steps:
+ 1st step: CRC cards
	a simple yet powerful object-oriented analysis technique for responsibility-driven design.
	CRC cards are useful for the users, analysts, and developers in the design process, 
		thus they are often used in the collaborative design of a system.
	They can help the entire development team to model, design, refine and understand the requirements of an OO software development project.
	Although not part of UML or other standards, CRC cards are considered a viable alternative to UML sequence diagrams to design the dynamics of object interaction and collaboration.
	A brainstorming tool in designing object-oriented software
		+ Class = Identify the key objects in the system.
		+ Responsibility =  What information each class should maintain/ What operations each class should provide
		+ Collaboration =  Identify interactions with other objects/ Reveal flow of control and information 
+ 2nd step: Design diagrams
		+ Class diagrams = Inheritance, part-of, inter-object relationship
		+ Object diagrams (snapshots) = Interactions between object instances
		+ Sequence diagrams (event scenarios) = Provides a functional view.
	All of these design diagrams use Unified Modelling Language (UML) notations.
		+ UML - a standardised general-purpose modelling language in the field of software.
		+ UML includes a set of graphical notation techniques to create abstract models of specific systems
		+ UML has many types of diagrams, which represent different structural information, 
			different types of behaviour, 
			or different aspects of interactions.
+ 3rd step: Design by contract
	defines formal, precise and sometimes verifiable interface specifications for software components.
	It extends standard class definitions with preconditions, postconditions and invariants.
	These specfications are referred to as contracts.
		+ State-based specification of objects = Invariant constraints allowable states​.
		+ Pre-conditions specify applicability of operations = Bestow benefits on implementers​.
		+ Post-conditions specify effect of operations = Impose obligations on implementers.
+ 4th step: Design patterns
	- Design patterns are a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
	- They are not necessarily a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.
	- Rather, they are used as a description or template, 
		derived from some best experience of expert OO program designer, 
		to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations
	- Design patterns capture best practice in OO design for commonly occurring problem scenarios. 
	- They can be used to identify specific design choices and implementation issues 
		and contain catalogues of aspects of class-based design

Visibility: To specify the visibility of a class member (i.e. any attribute or method), 
these notations must be placed before the members' name:
	+ public
	- private
	# protected
	~ Package
