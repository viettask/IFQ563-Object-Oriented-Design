Strategy ->  behavior design pattern

-	enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime
-	The main idea is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable
-	The Strategy Pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
	
Ex: Without Strategy pattern

    public class PaymentProcessor
    {
        public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount, string method)
        {
            if (method == "CreditCard")
            {
                // Logic to process credit card payment
                Console.WriteLine($"Processing {amount} via Credit Card");
            }
            else if (method == "PayPal")
            {
                // Logic to process PayPal payment
                Console.WriteLine($"Processing {amount} via PayPal");
            }
            // As new payment methods are added, more if-else statements are added here
        }
    }

// Usage
var paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
paymentProcessor.ProcessPayment(100.00m, "CreditCard");
paymentProcessor.ProcessPayment(75.50m, "PayPal");

==> let’s refactor the code to use the Strategy Pattern, making it more flexible and maintainable.
refactor = cấu trúc lại


Components of Strategy Method
1.	Strategy Interface:
	+ This defines a common interface for all concrete strategies. 
	+ It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy
2.  Context:
    + A class that contains a reference to a Strategy instance
    + It delegates the execution of a task to the strategy's implementation without having to understand the details of how the strategy works.
3.  Concrete Strategies:
    + These are individual classes that implement the Strategy Interface
    + Each represents a different algorithm or way of performing a task

Ex: Payment Processing System
    where different payment strategies might be required, such as Credit Card payments, PayPal, or Crytocurrency
    Payment strategies can often change or require additions, making it a suitable use case for the Strategy Pattern
    
    public interface IPaymentStrategy //IStrategy Interface
    {
        void ProcessPayment(decimal amount);
    }


    public class PaymentProcessor // Context
    {
        private IPaymentStrategy _paymentStrategy;

        public PaymentProcessor(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
        {
            _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
        }

        public void SetPaymentStrategy(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
        {
            _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
        }

        public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
        {
            _paymentStrategy.ProcessPayment(amount);
        }
    }

	public class CreditCardPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy //Concrete Strategies 1. credit card
    {
        public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
        {
            // Logic to process Credit Card payment
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing {amount} via Credit Card");
        }
    }

    public class PayPalPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy //Concrete Strategies 2. paypal
    {
        public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
        {
            // Logic to process PayPal payment
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing {amount} via PayPal");
        }
    }

    public class CryptoPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy //Concrete Strategies 3. crypto
    {
        public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing {amount} via Cryptocurrency");
            // Actual cryptocurrency processing logic
        }
    }

    var creditCardPayment = new PaymentProcessor(new CreditCardPaymentStrategy());
    creditCardPayment.ProcessPayment(100.00m); 
    // Output: Processing 100.00 via Credit Card

    var payPalPayment = new PaymentProcessor(new PayPalPaymentStrategy());
    payPalPayment.ProcessPayment(75.50m); 
    // Output: Processing 75.50 via PayPal

    var cryptoPayment = new PaymentProcessor(new CryptoPaymentStrategy());
    cryptoPayment.ProcessPayment(50.00m); 
    // Output: Processing 50.00 via Cryptocurrency

Advantages using Strategy Pattern
-   Ease of extension: 
    + You simply create a new class that implements the IPaymentStrategy interface
    + There's no need to modify any existing code
-   Adherence to Open/Closed principle:
    + The system is open for extension but closed for modification
    + You can add new payment strategies without altering existing classes
-   Simplicity and Maintainability:
    + The PaymentProcessor class remains simple and does not grow in complexity as new payment methods are added
    + Each payment method is encapsulated in its own class, making the system easier to understand and maintain
