Abstract Factory -> Creational design pattern

-	Abstract Factory is an interface for creating families of objects without specifying their concrete classes
-	It provides an interface for ceatng families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
-	Abstract Factory is useful for hiding actual implementation classes at time of creation
-	By using dynamic binding, other uses of actual classes are easier to hide behind interfaces.
-	The goal of Abstract Factory is to protect client from exposure to inheritance hierarchy

Problem:
	+ How can you create related objects?

Forces:
	+ Need to create families of related objects
	+ Objects in a family need to be used together

Solution:
	+ Make an abstract factory to create all the objects
	+ Factories share a common interface
	+ Client is configured with the appropriate factory

Consequences:
	+ Product families can be interchanged easily
	+ Adding new products is difficult

Abstract Factory applicability:
-	With regard to the applicability of using the creational pattern Abstract Factory,
	the following points should be considered:
	+ Make a system independent of how its products are created
	+ Configure a system with one of possibly multiple families of products
	+ Keep a family of related products together
	+ Reveal just the interface of a class library and not its implementation
	
Consequences of Abstract Factory:
-	Concrete factories can often be implemented as singletons
-	We don't need more than one factory for a family of products
-	Factory Method may be used for each product
-	Adding a new product to the families of project is not easy, because all concrete factories need to be changed to support this new product.
-	The following can be considered consequences of Abstract Factory:
	+ Abstract Factory isolates concrete classes
	+ Exchanging product families is easy
	+ Promotes consistency between product families
	+ Support new kinds of products when difficult
