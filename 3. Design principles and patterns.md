OO design patterns

3 common design patterns
- Template Method: 
	+ A core technique for code reuse in OO
	+ This pattern allows base class to define common parts of an algorithm while
		subclasses implementing other parts that can vary
- Factory Method:
	+ Defers object creation to subclasses.
	+ This pattern allows subclasses to override the methods in the base class
		to create objects of specific types.
- Composite:
	+ A uniformed interface for individual and compositions of objects.
	+ This pattern provides common interface to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly

How to make use of these design patterns

The template method:
- the template method is a template for defining algorithms
- It's the core technique for code reuse and extensibility in many OO applications

Question: How to capture similar behaviour against multiple classes?
Solution:
	- Achieve code reuse through inheritance
	- Need to adapt behaviours within subclasses
	- Need to restructure class hierarchies to extract commonalities
Template method:
- Define outline of algorithm in a parent class 
	+ Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm
- Define specialised steps of algorithmn in subclasses
- illustrates use of an abstract class
	+ The steps of the algorithm are made abstract
	+ The subclasses override the abstract methods to provide concrete behaviour
	+ In the abstract parent class, it defines primitive operations ( abstract or default(hook) code)
		and implements the template method with primitive operations
	+ In concrete subclasses, they implement abstract operations and specilise hook operations.

	In summary:
	- let subclasses implement behaviour that can vary:
		+ Abstract methods must be implemented
		+ Hook methods need not be abstract
	- Control at what point(s) subclassing is allowed
	- Avoid duplication in the code
		+ Look for the general code in the algorithm, and implement the variants in the subclasses
	- Inversed Control
		+ A parent class calls the operations of a subclass
	=> Template methods are a fundamental technique for code reuse.
	=> They are particularly important in class libraries
	=> The control structure is inversed as the result of the application of a template pattern
	=> This is often referred to as "Don't call us, we'll call you".
	=> Using this principle, the template method in a parent class controls the overall process by calling subclass methods as required 

The Factory method:
	- mainly deals with the problem of creating objects
		, typically without specifying the exact class or object that will be created
	- The term factory method is often used to refer to any method whose main purpose is the creation of objects
	
Problem: How can you defer the selection of concrete class?

Forces: Client code can't tell what subclass to use for creating objects
Solution: 
	+ The factory method design pattern handles this problem by defining a separate method for creating the objects.
	+ A factory method is usually not abstract - it does have default code.
	+ But a factory method will be overridden in the subclasses which specify the exact type of object that will be created.
	+ All objects created by a factory method have a common interface
	+ The factory method defines an interface for creating an object but lets the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
		=> let a class defer instantiation to subclasses
	+ A method returns an instance of one of several possible classes depending on the data provided to it
	+ All classes it returns have a common parent class and common methods (The client code can't tell what subclass)
	In summary:
		+ Base class defines separate (factory) methods for creating objects
		+ Concrete subclasses override these methods to create and return object instances of specific types
		+ Define the product interface: 
			- Common interface for different objects created by concrete creators
			- Product subclasses define actual instances
		+ Clients deal with abstract interfaces
		+ When this method is useful:
			- A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
			- A class wants its subclasses to spefify the objects it creates
			- The creation process is very complex
		+ Consequences of this method:
			- Give hooks for subclasses
			- Offer greater flexibility than direct instantiation

Question: The factory method pattern is very similar to which other pattern we have seen?
	= The template method pattern, as both parent classes give hooks for subclasses to specialise their behaviours.

Composite pattern:
-	The composite pattern is often described as a uniform interface for individual and compositions of objects
										(Giao diện thống nhất cho từng cá nhân và các thành phần của các đối tượng)

-	Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies (hierarchical structures)
	(Soạn thảo các đối tượng thành cấu trúc cây để biểu diễn hệ thống phân cấp 1 phần toàn thể)
-	The composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
	(Mẫu tổng hợp cho phép khách hàng xử lý các đối tượng riêng lẻ và các thành phần của đối tượng 1 cách thống nhất)
-	define recursive compositions of primitive and composite objects
	(Định nghĩa các thành phần đệ quy của các đối tượng nguyên thủy và hợp thành)
	Problem = How you can model whole-part hierarchies? 
			(Làm thế nào bạn có thể mô hình hóa hệ thống phân cấp toàn bộ-bộ phận?)
	Forces = you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects identically?
			(Bạn muốn khách hàng xử lý các đối tượng riêng lẻ và các thành phần của đối tượng giống hệt nhau)
	Solution =	Make a recursive tree of composite objects. 
				A consequence of this is that the client interface is simplified, 
				however, designing that interface is important. Uses include Windows systems or parse trees.

3 main categories of Design patterns
(Design patterns are resusable solutions to common problems in software design, ensuring code is maintainable and scalable)
1. Creational Design Patterns:

	- Sử dụng Creational patterns giúp tạo ra các đối tuong 1 cách linh hoat, de dang thay doi va toi uu hoa bo nhớ
	Ex: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
		+ Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that  provides an interface for creating objects,
		but allows subclasses to determine the actual object type.
		+ This promotes loose coupling and flexibility, enabling new object types without altering the client code.

	Ex: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
		+ The Composite pattern is a structural pattern that organizes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
		+ It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, making it ideal for building tree-like structures.

		+ Template method is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass,
		allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall structure.
		+ This promotes code resuse and lets subclasses refine algorithm steps.
