Strategy -> Behavioural design pattern

-	Client can make requests without knowing anything about the actual action that will be performed.
-	Allows the programmer to change the action without affecting the client program in any way.
-	Concept:
	+ encapsulates a request as an object, 
	+ thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with 
		different requests, 
		queue requests, 
		and support operations like 

Ex: Buttons & Menus need to carry out a request in response to user input.
	=>  But the designer of the buttons or menus cannot implement the request explicitly, coz he knows nothing about how they are used.
	=> Only applications that use these buttons and menus know what should be don on which object

Components of Command Method:
1. Command interface:
	+ declares an interface for executing an operation.
2. Receiver:
	+ knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out the request.
	+ Any class may serve as a Receiver.
3. Concrete Command: 
	+ defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action
	+ implements Execute by calling the corresponding actions on Receiver
4. Invoker:
	+ asks the command to carry out the request
5. Client:
	+ creates a concreteCommand object and sets its receiver.
	
Ex: A remote control for a light
		+ execute()
		+ undo()
		+ redo()

	// Command
	public interface ICommand
	{
		void Execute();
		void Undo();
		void Redo();
	}

	// Receiver
	public class Light
	{
		public void On()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Light is ON");
		}
		public void Off()
		{
		    Console.WriteLine("Light is OFF");
		}
	}

	// ConcreteCommand
	public class LightOnCommand : ICommand
	{
		private Light _light;
		public LightOnCommand(Light light)
		{
			_light = light;
		}
		public void Execute()
		{
		    _light.On();
		}
		public void Undo()
		{
			_light.Off();
		}
		public void Redo()
		{
			_light.On();
		}
	}

	// Invoker
	public class RemoteControl
	{
		private ICommand _command;
		public void SetCommand(ICommand command)
		{
			_command = command;
		}
		public void PressButton()
		{
			_command.Execute();
		}
	}

	// Client
	var light = new Light();					//Receiver
	var lightOn = new LightOnCommand(light);	//concreteCommand
	var remote = new RemoteControl();			//Invoker
	remote.SetCommand(lightOn);
	remote.PressButton();  // Output: Light is ON

Command interactions:
-	The client creates a ConcreteCommand object and specifies its receiver
-	An invoker object stores the ConcreteCommand object
-	When some event occurs (ex: selecting a menu item) the invoker makes a request by calling Execute() on the command
-	The ConcreteCommand object then invokes operations on its receiver to carry out the request.
	
Summary:
When using commands, consider that commands:
-	decouple invoker from executor
-	are first class
-	are good for undo/redo
	+ store history of commands in a list
	+ undo backtracks through list
	+ redo moves forward
	+ do throw away any remaining moves to be redone
-	log or queue executions
-	structure event-centered or transaction-centered systems
=>	By understanding and implementing this pattern, you can write more modular, flexible, and maintainable code in C#
